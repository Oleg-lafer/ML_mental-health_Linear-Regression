# Mental Health Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution to analyze and predict mental health outcomes based on various factors. Utilizing linear regression, the model aims to provide insights into the relationship between demographic and lifestyle factors and mental health conditions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the implementation.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: For building and training the linear regression model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations on arrays.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization (if applicable).

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes various features related to individuals' demographics and lifestyle choices, including:

- Age
- Marital Status
- Education Level
- Number of Children
- Smoking Status
- Physical Activity Level
- Employment Status
- Income
- Alcohol Consumption
- Dietary Habits
- Sleep Patterns
- History of Mental Illness
- History of Substance Abuse
- Family History of Depression
- Chronic Medical Conditions

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Oleg-lafer/javaScript-nodejs-tutorial.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <your_project_directory>
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
5. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Results

- **Mean Squared Error**: Provides an indication of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **R-squared**: Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables.
